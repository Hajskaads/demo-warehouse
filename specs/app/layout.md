The layout is the root layout component that wraps the entire application. It sets up the structure and styling for the application's HTML structure. Here are the technical specifications:

1. Dependencies:

   - `@components/layout/navbar/navbar`: The component imports the `Navbar` component from a module, which represents the application's navigation bar.
   - `./globals.css`: The component imports a CSS file named "globals.css" which likely contains global styles for the application.
   - `next/font/google`: The component imports the `Inter` font from the Google Fonts API.
   - `react`: The component uses the `ReactNode` type and the `Suspense` component from the React library.
   - `@components/layout/footer`: The component imports the `Footer` component from a module, which represents the application's footer.

2. Render:
   - Renders an `<html>` element with the `lang` attribute set to "es" (Spanish) and the `className` attribute set to the `inter.className` value. This likely applies the Inter font to the entire application.
   - Renders a `<body>` element with various CSS classes applied to it. These classes likely define the background color, text color, and selection styles for the body element.
   - Inside the `<body>`, there is a `<div>` element with the class `min-h-screen flex flex-col`. This div represents the main container for the application.
   - Inside the main container div, there are the following child elements:
     - The `Navbar` component, which represents the application's navigation bar.
     - Another `<div>` element with the class `flex-grow`, which represents the main content area of the application.
       - Inside the content area div, there is another `<div>` element with the classes `max-w-3xl`, `flex-grow`, `pt-5`, `pb-20`, and `sm:mx-auto`. These classes likely define the maximum width, spacing, and positioning of the main content area.
         - Inside the content area div, there is a `Suspense` component.
           - Inside the `Suspense` component, there is a `<main>` element that wraps the `children` prop. This represents the main content of the application.
     - The `Footer` component, which represents the application's footer.

Note: The code snippet provides an overview of the component's structure and some of its dependencies. The functionality and behavior of specific components (`Navbar`, `Footer`) are not detailed in the code snippet.
