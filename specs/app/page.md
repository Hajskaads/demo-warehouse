The page is the main component that displays a collection of items with their respective quantities. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Dependencies:

   - `react`: The component uses the `Suspense` component from the React library.
   - `@components/layout/list/list`: The component imports the `List` component from a module, which represents a list of items.

2. Functions:
   - `handleGetProductStock`: An asynchronous function that sends a GET request to the specified URL (retrieved from the `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL` environment variable) and retrieves the available products' data. It returns the array of available products if the request is successful; otherwise, it shows an error alert.
   - `ItemList`: An asynchronous function that awaits the result of `handleGetProductStock` and renders different components based on the availability of products. If there are no available products, it shows an error message; otherwise, it renders the `List` component with the available products.
3. Constants:

   - `skeleton`: A string that represents CSS classes for a loading skeleton.
   - `activeAndTitles`: A string that represents CSS classes for the active and title elements.
   - `items`: A string that represents CSS classes for the items.
   - `title`, `name`, `qty`: Strings that represent the title, name, and quantity labels for the collection.

4. Render:
   - Renders a `<div>` element with various CSS classes and attributes applied to it. These classes likely define the styling and layout of the collection component.
   - Inside the main `<div>`, there is the following content:
     - An optional `<h3>` element that displays the `title` if it exists. This element is hidden on smaller screens.
     - A `<div>` element that represents the table header row with three columns: name, quantity, and a spacer for the delete icon.
     - A `Suspense` component that handles the loading state of the item list.
       - Inside the `Suspense` component, there is an `<ItemList>` component. The `ItemList` component is responsible for fetching the product stock data and rendering the appropriate content based on the availability of products.

Note: The code snippet provides an overview of the component's structure and some of its dependencies. The functionality and behavior of specific components (`List`, `ItemList`) are not detailed in the code snippet.
