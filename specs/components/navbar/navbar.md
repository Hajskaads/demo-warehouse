Navbar is a React functional component named `Navbar`. It represents a navigation bar and includes various components and icons. Here are the technical specifications:

1. Dependencies:

   - `next/link`: The component uses the `Link` component from Next.js to create a link.
   - `react`: The component uses the `Suspense` component from the React library.
   - `components/icons/logo`: The component imports the `LogoIcon` component from a module, which likely represents a custom logo icon.
   - `@components/icons/plus`: The component imports the `PlusIcon` component from a module, which likely represents a custom plus icon.
   - `@components/layout/navbar/uploadJson/addJsonButton`: The component imports the `AddJsonButton` component from a module.
   - `./refreshButton`: The component imports the `RefreshButton` component from a local file.
   - `@components/icons/repeat`: The component imports the `RepeatIcon` component from a module, which likely represents a custom repeat icon.
   - `../restoreDbButton`: The component imports the `RestoreDbButton` component from a local file.

2. Render:
   - Renders a `<nav>` element with the class `relative flex items-center justify-center bg-white p-4 dark:bg-black lg:px-6`.
   - Inside the `<nav>`, there is a `<div>` element with the class `flex items-center justify-between w-full max-w-7xl` to contain the navigation bar content.
   - The content within the `<div>` is divided into three sections using CSS classes for responsiveness:
     - The first section represents the logo and company name.
     - The second section is hidden on small screens and displays a short company name.
     - The third section is hidden on small screens and displays a longer company name.
   - The second section includes a `RestoreDbButton` component wrapped in a `Suspense` component to handle lazy loading and fallback rendering.
   - The third section includes a `RefreshButton` component wrapped in a `Suspense` component and a `PlusIcon` component wrapped in another `Suspense` component. Both handle lazy loading and fallback rendering.

Note: The CSS classes used in the code snippet (`flex`, `items-center`, `justify-center`, etc.) are likely part of a specific styling framework or convention used in the project and may have custom styling associated with them.
