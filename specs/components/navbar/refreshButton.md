RefreshButton is a React functional component named `RefreshButton`. It represents a button with a refresh icon that triggers a page refresh when clicked. Here are the technical specifications:

1. Dependencies:

   - `@components/icons/repeat`: The component imports the `RepeatIcon` component from a module, which likely represents a custom repeat icon.
   - `next/navigation`: The component imports the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to access the router object.
   - `react`: The component uses the `useTransition` hook from the React library.

2. Render:
   - Renders a `<div>` element with the class `flex mr-2`.
   - Inside the `<div>`, there is a `<button>` element with various CSS classes and attributes:
     - The `className` attribute conditionally applies CSS classes based on the `isPending` state. If `isPending` is `true`, the button gets the classes `cursor-not-allowed` and `text-gray-400`, and it also adds the `animate-pulse` animation class. These classes are likely responsible for visual effects when the button is in a pending state.
     - The button has a `hover:bg-blue-600` class, which likely changes the background color when hovered.
     - The button has a `hover:cursor-pointer` class, indicating that the cursor changes to a pointer when hovered.
     - The button has the `rounded-full` class, which likely applies rounded corners to the button.
     - The button has a `p-0.5` class, which likely sets the padding of the button.
     - The `disabled` attribute is set to the `isPending` state value, preventing the button from being clicked when it is in a pending state.
     - The `onClick` event handler triggers the `startTransition` function when the button is clicked. Inside the `startTransition` function, the `router.refresh()` method is called to refresh the page.
   - Inside the button, there is a `RepeatIcon` component with the class `h-8`, which likely sets the height of the repeat icon.

Note: The CSS classes used in the code snippet (`flex`, `mr-2`, `hover:bg-blue-600`, etc.) are likely part of a specific styling framework or convention used in the project and may have custom styling associated with them.
