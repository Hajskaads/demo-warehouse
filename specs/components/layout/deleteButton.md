DeleteButton is a React functional component named `DeleteButton`. It renders a delete button with a close icon and handles the deletion of a product. Here are the technical specifications:

1. Dependencies:

   - `react`: The component uses the `useState` and `startTransition` hooks from the React library.
   - `next/navigation`: The component uses the `useRouter` hook from the Next.js navigation module.
   - `@components/icons/close`: The component imports the `CloseIcon` component from the specified path, which likely represents a custom close icon.

2. Props:

   - `productId` (required): Represents the ID of the product to be deleted.
   - `quantity` (optional): Represents the quantity of the product (default value is 1).

3. State:

   - `router`: Uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to access the router instance.
   - `removing`: A boolean state variable that tracks whether the deletion process is in progress or not.

4. Functionality:

   - `handleRemove()`: An asynchronous function that handles the removal of the product.
     - Sets the `removing` state to `true`.
     - Sends a DELETE request to the `/api/product` API endpoint with the `productId` and `quantity` as query parameters.
     - If there is an error in the response, an alert with the error message is displayed, and the `removing` state is set back to `false`.
     - If the deletion is successful:
       - Sets the `removing` state back to `false`.
       - Uses the `startTransition` function from React to start a transition.
       - Calls the `router.refresh()` function to refresh the current page.

5. Render:
   - Renders a `<button>` element with the appropriate class and attributes:
     - The `className` is conditionally set based on the `removing` state to control the button appearance.
     - The `onClick` event is bound to the `handleRemove` function.
     - The `disabled` attribute is set based on the `removing` state to disable the button during the deletion process.
   - Renders the `CloseIcon` component with the specified `className` and a fixed height of `h-6`.
   - The entire content is wrapped inside a `<div>` element with the class `flex mr-2`.

Note: Some parts of the code, such as the `@components/icons/close` import and the CSS classes, may depend on the project-specific configuration and styling choices.
