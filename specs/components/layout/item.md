Item is a React functional component named `ProductItem`. It represents a single item in a product list. Here are the technical specifications:

1. Dependencies:

   - `@components/icons/close`: The component imports the `CloseIcon` component from the specified path, which likely represents a custom close icon.
   - `react`: The component uses the `Suspense` component from the React library.
   - `./deleteButton`: The component imports the `DeleteButton` component from a local file.

2. Props:

   - `product` (required): Represents an object of type `ProductStock` containing information about a specific product.

3. Render:
   - Renders a `<div>` element with the class `w-full flex items-center bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-md px-4 py-1`.
   - Inside the `<div>`, there are three `<span>` elements representing different sections of the product item:
     - The first `<span>` occupies one-third of the width and displays the `product.name` value.
     - The second `<span>` occupies one-third of the width and displays the `product.stock` value.
     - The third `<span>` occupies one-third of the width and is aligned to the right. It contains the `DeleteButton` component wrapped in a `Suspense` component.
   - The `Suspense` component serves as a fallback while waiting for the `DeleteButton` component to load asynchronously. It renders the `CloseIcon` component with the class `h-6 text-red-600`.
   - The `DeleteButton` component is rendered with the `productId` prop set to `product.id`.

Note: The CSS classes used in the code snippet (`w-full`, `flex`, `items-center`, etc.) are likely part of a specific styling framework or convention used in the project and may have custom styling associated with them.
