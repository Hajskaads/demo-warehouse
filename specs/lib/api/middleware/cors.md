The provided code snippet defines a function called `handleCors` that handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for incoming requests. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Dependencies:
   - `next`: The code imports the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` types from the "next" module. These types represent the incoming request object and the response object, respectively.

2. CORS handling:
   - The `handleCors` function takes in the `req` (NextApiRequest) and `res` (NextApiResponse) objects as parameters.
   - It first checks if the current environment is not in development mode. This check is performed to prevent CORS headers from being set in the development environment since the development server automatically handles CORS.
   - If the environment is not in development mode, the function proceeds to check the request's origin against an allowlist of URLs defined in the `allowlist` array.
   - If the request's origin is found in the allowlist, the function sets the appropriate CORS headers in the response object:
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: Sets the value of the `Origin` header in the response to the request's origin.
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Specifies the allowed HTTP methods for the CORS request. In this case, only `GET` and `OPTIONS` methods are allowed. You can modify this line to allow additional methods if needed (e.g., `GET, POST, OPTIONS`).
     - `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Sets the allowed request headers in the response. The headers specified in this line allow the most common headers used in requests.
   - If the request's origin is not found in the allowlist, the function sends a 401 (Unauthorized) response with an error message indicating that the request is unauthorized.

Note: The code uses the `process.env.WEBSITE_URL` environment variable to define the allowlist. Make sure to set this environment variable with the appropriate URL(s) before using this code. Additionally, the function should be used as middleware in your API routes to handle CORS for incoming requests.
